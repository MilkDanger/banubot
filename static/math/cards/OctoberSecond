An ordered pair (a . b),is a set of the form {a . {a . b}}
Let A . B be sets. The cartesian product AXB is,{(a . b) | a e A, b e B}
A relation between 2 sets A & B, any subset R of AXB ie R C AXB
R is a relation ON A,if R C AXA
a is related to b by the relation R. aRb, (a . b) e R
Let R C AXA (relation on A). R is REFLEXIVE if,aRa for every a e A
R is SYMMETRIC if,aRb -> bRa for every a & b e A
R is TRANSITIVE if,aRb and bRc -> aRc for every a,b,c e A
R has TRICHOTOMY if, for every a & b e A exactly 1 of: aRb OR bRa OR a = b
