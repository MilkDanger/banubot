Let A be a set. A relation on A is TOTAL ORDER, when it is transitive and has trichotomy. Written "<"
Let U be a set with total order <. Let A C U. Say m e U is a LOWER BOUND of A when, m <= x for all x e A
Say m e U is an UPPER BOUND of A when, m >= x for all x e A
Say m e U is the MINIMUM of A if, #1. m <= x for every x e A #2. m e A
Say m e U is the MAXIMUM of A if, #1. m >= x for every x e A #2. m e A
Say m e U is the INFIMUM of A if, #1. m <= x for every x e A #2. if l > m then l > x (if l if larger than m it's not a lower bound)
Say m e U is the SUPREMUM of A if, #1. m >= x for every x e A #2. if l < m then l < x for some x e A
If the maximum (minimum infimum supremum) exists then, it is unique
