b is a MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSE of a if (rationals)| a * b = b * a = 1
An ORDERED FIELD is| a set F with the following properties: (next card)
1| there exists a total order < on F
2| for all a, b ϵ F, a unique a + b ϵ F
3| + is commutative
4| + is associative
5| there exists an additive identity called 0
6| for all a ϵ F, there exists an additive inverse -a
7| if a < b, a + c < b + c
8| for all a, b ϵ F, there exists a unique a * b ϵ F
9| * is commutative
10| * is associative
11| there exists a multiplicative identity called 1
12| if a ϵ F and a /= 0, there exists a multiplicative inverse 1/a or a-1
13| if a < b and c > 0, a * c < b * c
